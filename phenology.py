    """ Phenology scheme based on Botta calibration against EO data. The 
    estimated leaf out/off dates are used to define the allocation of C&N in the
    deciduous model as a function of soil+air temperature and daylength.
    
    Clearly the aim is for this to be simple, but I need to revisit this at 
    some point. Things to do:
    - model is only valid outside of the tropics due to daylength dependance
    - we need a drought deciduous leaf drop
    - grasses don't behave like deciduous forests. So that is a fairly urgent
      change need for FACE sims.
    - Need some catch to alert the user if leaves haven't been dropped for some
      reason. This is a common occurrence due to some other issue but it is 
      currently hard to track down! 
      
    - Look at Caldararu et al 2014, Phenology as a strategy for carbon 
      optimality: a global model. Seems interesting at a quick glance.

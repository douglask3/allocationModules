\chapter{Introduction}

Here we test several allocation models using the Gday vegetation model tool thing \citep{Comins1993,Corbeels2005}. Currently these include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Fixed allocation: Allocation of carbin between root wood and leaf is constant
	\item Alloemtric: Employed by most vegetation models that use the ``pipe'' model this allocates carbon to maintain allomry/functional balance
	\item MaxGPP: GPP is maximised through changes in leaf allocation
	\item MaxW GPP is maximised through changes in leaf and wood allocation.
\end{itemize}

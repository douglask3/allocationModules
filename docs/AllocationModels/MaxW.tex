\section{MaxW}
Max W works much the same and MaxGPP, but instead of optimizing for GPP, it attempts to maximise wood production. This is  based on the model described by  \citep{McMurtrie2013}. For MaxW, the cost function represents carbon production directed to wood:

\begin{equation}
	\phi(A_{leaf},A_{wood}) = - GPP (GDAY_{d+1}(A_{leaf},A_{wood})) * A_{wood}
\end{equation}

Optimal $A_{leaf}$ and $A_{wood}$ are again found by minimising $\phi$:

\begin{equation*}
A_{leaf,d,optimal} \text{\&} A_{wood,d,optimal}=
\begin{aligned}
& \underset{A_{leaf}, A_{wood}}{\text{minimize}}
& & \phi(A_{leaf,A_{wood}}) \\
& \text{subject to}
& & 0 \leq A_{leaf} \leq A_{leaf,max} \&
& & 0 \leq A_{wood} \leq A_{leaf,max}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

 daily $A_{wood}$ and $A_{leaf}$ is again the average over past season:

\begin{equation}
	A_{x}= \sum_{D}^{d=D-N} A_{x,d,optimal}
\end{equation}

where $x$ is $leaf$ or $wood$.
